## Assignment Overview

This project covers the implementation of exhaustive, hill climbing, and genetic algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. There are selected test case outcomes in /results including benchmarks, plots, and text output files. To run the code found in /src please execute the following commands.

### User Input for all parameters to solve their choice of conditions pertaining to this situation
```
python main.py
```

### To run selected test cases (as requested by prompt)
Please note that this can take a while due to the use of large genetic algorithm population sizes.

```
python testing.py
```

All data will be available in /results

### To plot the fitness of the genetic algorithm as Generation vs Distance
```
python plotting.py
```

All plots will be in /results/plots
